# Quick Capture Methods

Capture is the foundation of GTD. The faster you can get something out of your head and into Flow, the less mental energy you waste.

Since Obsidian notes are plain text files, you can capture from almost any tool that can write to files.

## Built-in Methods

### Obsidian Commands

- **Add to inbox** — Opens the capture modal
- **Ribbon icon** — Click the inbox icon in the left ribbon

### Flow CLI

Quick capture from the terminal:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @flow/cli

# First run prompts for vault path
flow "buy milk"

# Subsequent captures
flow "call dentist"

# Override vault
flow --vault ~/Obsidian/Work "meeting notes"
```

Configure the CLI inbox file in Settings → Flow.

## Tips

- **Reduce friction** — The best capture method is the one you'll actually use
- **Don't organise while capturing** — Just get it out of your head
- **Multiple inboxes** — Consider separate inboxes for work and personal
- **Process regularly** — Capture only works if you trust you'll process it
