# Flow

## What is Flow?

Flow is a life planning system using the concepts and processes from David Allen's Getting Things Done (GTD).

It's based on the principle that your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.

We waste time keeping track of the things we have to do in life. From the basics such as 'buy more cat food' to the multi-month project at work – all of these responsibilities we have to store in our heads use up space and cycles that we should use for the things we want to do in that moment.

Flow will help you put every one of these projects, tasks, and ideas into Obsidian – in a format that works for you – so you can have a mind like water and focus fully on the task in hand.

Getting into the flow state when working on something is a wonderful experience. All too often we're distracted by something popping up in our head that we may have forgotten about. Flow helps you get those things out of your head and into the Flow system immediately, allowing you to maintain your focus – your Flow state.

## How does it work?

First, let's explain a core principle of Flow.

> Flow should not dictate how you store your information in Obsidian.

Yes, it's an Obsidian plugin. We're all-in on Obsidian, and are proud to use it as the foundation for Flow. So you have to use Obsidian to get the most out of it.

People use Obsidian in different ways, and we don't want to dictate how you should use it. Flow is designed to work with how you organise your vault. We are opinionated about a few things but we try not to impact the incredible flexibility that Obsidian offers.

### Why Flow helps keep your mind like water

Flow helps you take of the thoughts and ideas that pop up in your head at any moment, as well as the requests and actions that appear in our email, in our letterbox, on our phones, through chatting to friends and colleagues – any time we have something we need to think about or do later it can go into Flow. This prevents us from storing these things in our head allowing us to think freely about what we're doing at any one time.

## Flow concepts

Let's go through the concepts of Flow. If you're familiar with Getting Things Done, then you'll recognise a lot of this. That's by design – we're huge fans of the GTD methodology.

-   Inboxes and Drops
-   Sources
-   Spheres
-   Projects and Actions
-   People
-   Processing and Planning

### Inboxes and Drops

All the 'stuff' that comes to us we capture in an 'inbox'. We call each bit of stuff, e.g. each individual thought or request, a 'drop'.

In Flow we have two inboxes. The first is a folder containing files, each file containing a single drop. The second is a folder containing files, each file containing lines which represent a single drop.

This is the entry point for all of our 'stuff'. We can put anything in here. It doesn't have to be detailed or too considered. Later on we process these drops so they never go missing or get forgotten.

### Sources

Getting drops into Flow is as simple as writing a note or line in one of your inboxes.

This works, but can take some time to open Obsidian, open the note and then write out the drop.

Sources are a key part of getting drops into Flow with minimal friction. Your goal is to be distracted from your thinking as little as possible – the more work you have to do to record your drop in your inbox, the more likely you are to drop what's in your head.

Sources aren't included in Flow by default as by their nature they sit outside of Obsidian and the plugin. However, we provide some ideas and instructions to create sources that fit into your life and workflows. We'd love to hear how you've created sources so we can share them with other Flow users.

### Projects and Actions

You may already have a to-do list, or you may keep everything in your head. For a lot of people, it's a mixture of both! Flow introduces the concepts of Projects, People, and Actions to help you keep things organised in a way that captures everything and doesn't overwhelm you.

A project is anything that consists of more than one action. It's common to put actions like '- buy a new kettle' on your to-do list. However, you can't look at that and immediately buy a kettle. You may want to first research the latest in kettle technology, or speak to your partner about what was wrong with the old kettle before making a decision on what you need.

So buying a kettle becomes a Project in Flow, and the Action is 'speak to Kai to find out what type of kettle we want'.

This prevents us from looking at our to-do list and seeing big projects that we don't know how to start, and therefore procrastinate over... instead we always consider what the next action is (or next actions are!) to move the project forward. When it comes to actually doing things it's much easier for us to get going.

This is a powerful feature of Flow that we took from Getting Things Done and it makes a huge difference to how you view what's on your plate.

### People

People are treated in the same way as Projects in Flow. You can have 'next actions' for a person which we call 'Discuss next'. You can send Drops to People in the same way you do for a Project.

### Spheres

Spheres allow you to separate different parts of your life. For example, you can have a work sphere and a personal sphere. Spheres help separate projects and tasks when you are in a certain mode.

Note that having multiple spheres are optional, and a lot of processes don't care for spheres except when categorising a project or an action. You need at least one sphere.

### Processing + Planning (needs wordsmithing)

Flow shines in the processes it enables to capture your thoughts and ideas into one place, and then how you decide what it is you want to do at any given point in time.

#### Processing your inboxes

Processing your inbox is made simple with Flow. It helps you reframe your Drops into clear next actions instead of nebulous, unapproachable items.

It takes a bit of thought at this point, but the beauty of creating clear next actions means you're able to move these projects forward.

#### Planning your day

Each day you plan afresh, reviewing your next actions and choosing what you want to do that day. This does two things:

-   It helps avoids busy work
    -   It forces you to choose the things that you need to move forward. As they're next actions, they're all achievable, and you don't skip the important big projects because it's easier to get satisfaction
-   It prevents items from sitting on a to-do list forever, the rollover to-do list containing things you know you'll never start working on
    -   The paradox of them becoming invisible to you, but causing you pain every time you skip over them

## How to use Flow

### Processing inboxes

TODO: Write this

-   Run the command: Process Inboxes

#### Planning your day

TODO: Write this

-   Run the command: Process Inboxesbsidian-api

#### Notes

-   If you rename a task that you've already added to your planned list, you'll see a warning. Currently there's no easy way to link tasks so we rely on the task text to match the task in the planned list to do this. If you rename a task, this link will be broken. That's okay, but it won't show if you refresh the planned list, and you won't be able to mark it as done from the planned list.
